# Spotify-tui-Patched
This project is a modified and updated version of github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) â€” a terminal user interface for Spotify written in **Rust**.   The main goal of this fork is to fix authentication issues caused by recent Spotify API changes that invalidated certain redirect URL formats (`redirect_uri`).
